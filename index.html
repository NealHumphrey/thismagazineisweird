	<p>I love unicorns! They are amazing. me and myfamily went to califonia we met this dude who sells stuffed unicorns he was homless. so, we gave him extra money and a tip
	Than we went to unicorn happy world! So many smiley unicorns and rainbows! Skyler rode on The Unicorn ThunderBOLT (rolicoster) and she went flying off the The Unicorn ThunderBolt 
	and landed on to the pile of stuffed unicorns next to the homeless man! Than me Allyssa peed my pants cause I was scared I was gonna go flying off. Which I did. Than I peed
	even more. Except I went flying and landed in a pit of unicorns with... RAYBIES! JUST KIDDING!</p>
